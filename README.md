# Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces problems. Codeforces is a competitive programming platform where I practice my problem-solving skills and improve my algorithmic knowledge.

## Structure

- Each problem solution is organized in a separate folder.
- Inside each folder, you will find the source code file(s) and any necessary input/output files.
- The source code is written in C++ and follows best practices for readability and efficiency.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Blaster2398/CodeForces_git/
    ```

2. Navigate to the specific problem folder you are interested in.

3. Compile and run the source code file(s) using your preferred compiler or IDE.

4. If necessary, provide the input as mentioned in the problem statement.

5. Compare the output with the expected output to verify the correctness of the solution.
